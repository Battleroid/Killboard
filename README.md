Killboard
=========

Forge mod for Minecraft that just keeps a record of PvP kill/deaths. Basic and my god do I not remember Java good. Records usernames, UUID on join. Player deaths are incremented when they die, kills are recorded when they kill another player.

## Requirements

Obviously you need Forge installed for your server, just plop it into mods. Built against **Forge 1.7.10-10.13.0.1183**.
